# Arduino-Board

## Week 1
We installed the drivers on and ran the program on the computer. The board was set up in the correct way with all the parts in the correct places

## Week 2
We continued setting up the board and tried running a blink program. The program worked after a couple of tries. We ran into some obstacles but they were resolved.

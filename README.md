# Arduino-Board

## Week 1
We installed the drivers on and ran the program on the computer. The board was set up in the correct way with all the parts in the correct places.

## Week 2
We continued setting up the board and tried running a blink program. The program worked after a couple of tries. We ran into some obstacles but they were resolved. 

## Week 3
We tried running the program with the the button push to turn the light on. At first it didn't work, but then, we tried repositioning some of the parts to make it work.

## Week 4
We got help and finally figured out how to make the button program run. We played around with it and changed some intervals.

# Arduino-Board

## Week 1
We installed the drivers on and ran the program on the computer. The board was set up in the correct way with all the parts in the correct places.

## Week 2
We continued setting up the board and tried running a blink program. The program worked after a couple of tries. We ran into some obstacles but they were resolved. 

## Week 3
We tried running the program with the the button push to turn the light on. At first it didn't work, but then, we tried repositioning some of the parts to make it work.

## Week 4
We got help and finally figured out how to make the button program run. We played around with it and changed some intervals.

## Week 5
We added a delay to the SimpleToggle program and light turns on a lot better when the button is pressed. After, we tried using millis instead of delay, because delay stops the program. We encountered obstacles in our new code but we figured out it out with the placement of our new coding. There was a problem with printing things out because we thought that the language was java but then we figured out how to do it.
